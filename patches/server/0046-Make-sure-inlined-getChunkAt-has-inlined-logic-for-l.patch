Subject: [PATCH] Make sure inlined getChunkAt has inlined logic for loaded
 chunks

Tux did some profiling some time ago and showed that the
previous getChunkAt method which had inlined logic for loaded
chunks did get inlined, but the standard CPS.getChunkAt
method was not inlined.

Paper recently reverted this optimisation, so it's been reintroduced
here.
