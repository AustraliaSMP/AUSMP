## Bug Tracker / Feature Requests
**Before making a new bug report or feature suggestion, please read through all open issues (in the issues tab) before submitting a new issue.**

I will review all feature suggestions and bug reports and either decide to move forward or leave them in a queue to come back to later depending on the severity and/or usefulness. Please be patient. I may ask for additional info if you report a bug without enough information so be sure to check on the status of the issue from time to time.
